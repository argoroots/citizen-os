Citizen OS Platform Demo.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello and welcome to Citizenos.com.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,440
Click on the Use Platform button.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,120
The platform is available in many languages,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,700
so select your language and if it is not yet supported, please let us know.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,620
These are all public topics that are being discussed right now.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,950
You can click on them, read them, but in order to

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,960
participate, you need to login using your Facebook or Google account,

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,400
the Estonian ID card, or by creating a new user account.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,840
Once I have logged in,

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,240
this argument section becomes active and I can make my main statement here,

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:51,660
explain and prove it and post as a pro or con argument. To create your own topic,

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,020
go to create topic on the left hand menu.

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,520
And here you can edit the document with

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,920
others at the same time.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,900
Inline comments are available while in editing mode.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,800
Go to to settings to make the topic private or public add a Twitter hashtag,

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,520
invite users to join or share the link.

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,440
To get an overview of your topics,

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,780
go to my topics on the left-hand menu.

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,360
Here you can assign editing rights to the users you invited.

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,100
If you want to discuss many topics with the same group of people,

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,020
you can create groups.

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,860
Every time a new topic is created, members get an automatic email.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,360
If you need to vote to reach a decision, you can send the topic to vote.

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,000
Now the topic can no longer be edited. You can choose between regular and

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,640
custom vote. And delegation of the vote is also possible, which means

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,700
for this topic people can delegate their vote to another user.

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,480
You can also set a deadline for the voting.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,780
While voting is open, you cannot see the results to not influence the outcome of the vote.

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,160
Once everyone has voted or the voting deadline has arrived,

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,100
you can send the topic to follow-up.

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,060
Here, you can post brief updates on how the decision is moving along.

34
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,800
How much does Citizen OS cost?

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
It is free to use for everyone forever on your mobile, tablet or computer.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
Thanks for watching.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
