1
00:00:00,000 -->  00:00:02,000
The way that the system currently functions

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
is built on traditions and the way that

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
things have always been. It's an online

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
collaborative decision-making tool, which

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
basically means that if you have many

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
people that want to discuss proposed

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
arguments, decide, vote on things together -

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
they no longer have to meet in the

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
same physical space - often that would be

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
impossible because there's too many of

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
them or they are too geographically

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
spread out. We have been using Citizen

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
OS for a simple organizational task

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
where we need our supervisory board

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
members, who are around the world

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
sometimes and not always physically

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
available, to review our internal policy

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
documents. The only way for us to move

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
forward as a civilization is to learn to

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
really make use of that new quality

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
of connectedness. Citizen OS enables that.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can bring a big number of people, you

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
can decide on things, petitions or

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
decisions or documents. For a

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
non-profit organization, for a civic

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
movement, for a village municipality. Up

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to the level of a national

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
government or even the citizens of a

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
planet. There's no upper limit

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
other than the planet. We are part of

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
democracy festivals network, so that

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
means that

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In our  festival, we hope to

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
develop opinion culture in Estonia.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Citizen OS could help us on a new

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
level, to achieve better quality

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
discussions in opinion festival. It's a

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
flavour of things to come. It

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
shows us what technology enables in

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the information society where you can

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
actually get the participation of big,

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
big numbers of people to jointly come

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
together and change things.
