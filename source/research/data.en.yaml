            ### We use science and data to better understand the effects of participatory democracy.

            We work with researchers, whose interests lay in the areas of e-democracy, political theory and decision-making. Our resident research associate, Kadi Maria Vooglaid has consulted us on involvement in policymaking, the theories behind political decision-making and different voting systems.

            ## COSCon
            ### Citizen OS’s own conference

            Our first conference, “Political Representation in the Digital Age”, was held in 2017. The topics were:
            - How do politicians, academics and activists perceive the limits of representative democracy in 2017 and for the years to come?
            - Can current institutions handle radically new practices?
            - Will civic technologies really change politics?
