      ## An Invitation to Collaborate

      We at Citizen OS, a civic tech non-profit based working all around the world to enhance democracy and participation in civil society, cordially invite you to collaborate in the development of a new community of practice – the Participatory Youth Leadership Network (PYLN).

      ## The Network

      The Participatory Youth Leadership Network is a dedicated network for youth organisations all across India to collaborate and share best practice in the areas of participatory leadership and civic engagement.

      As part of the network, members will gain valuable insights, skills, knowledge and contacts to help achieve their youth organisation’s goals in the most innovative and democratic ways.

      The network will be divided into two parts – external collaboration and internal collaboration.

      External collaboration involves a comprehensive programme of free webinars, workshops, training
      sessions and networking on topics such as inclusive leadership, constructive argumentation, theory of change and values-centred approaches. This programme will be attended by youth organisations in India, Citizen OS and our international contributors.

      Internal collaboration involves organisations forming their own steering groups and deciding their own agendas using the civic tools provided by [Citizen OS](https://citizenos.com/platform/). Let it be said, the use of our platform is strictly voluntary, members can use any platform that they mutually agree upon.

      ## The Process

      Keeping in mind that countries have different contexts, we would like the India chapter of PYLN to focus on building a community of practice in the Indian context. We are looking at community members to form their own steering groups, keeping in mind their organisational interests.

      However, as mentioned above, our international contributors will join our structured programme in order to learn, understand and share.

      ## Network Members

      Membership is open to all organisations that work towards youth empowerment and/or youth engagement in India, as well as youth leaders (individuals). There is no age-restriction for community members.

      Any member of the organisation (including volunteers and interns) are welcome to collaborate with us.
      Some members can also avail of certificates of participation if they feel it will be of benefit to them.

      ## Program Contributors

      International contributors who would like to use this opportunity to reflect upon best practices.

      ## The Future

      We are looking at developing a more global network in the future.

      ## The Background

      Currently, both India and Estonia are making significant progress in the area of e-governance projects. The National Policy on Information Technology 2012 has promoted open-source software for economic growth in India, and this has also been reflected in initiatives such as MyGov.in which look at citizen sourcing as an innovation approach. Similarly, Estonia has one of the most developed e-governance systems in the world, with the Estonian government continuously in the process of leveraging ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) to improve the lives of citizens.

      However, our analysis has been that there is a gap in India and Estonia and across the world, when it comes to technology-driven citizen participation, that is truly “bottom-up”, or where citizens are empowered to self-organise and utilise their own learning paths, outside of conventional hackathons and open-source communities.

      Currently, Citizen OS has a vibrant and active international ['Civic Hacktivist' community](https://citizenos.com/community/). However, this community focuses on the “Civic” and the “Tech” in more or less equal parts. The Participatory Youth Leadership Network will look at broader applications of Design Thinking and Value-Sensitive Design to address gaps in Participatory Leadership.

      ## Platform Objectives

      The overall objective of the Participatory Youth Leadership Network is to enable structured collaboration between member organisations on the topics of participation, inclusive leadership and civic engagement.

      This collaboration occurs through:

      - Planning and gap analysis workshops
      - Leadership and argumentation training
      - Project presentations and feedback sessions

      ## Platform Values

      **Equal opportunities for participation**

      The creation of equal opportunities for participation for all citizens, and bridging participation gaps that may occur as a direct or indirect consequence of marginalisation.

      **Empowering youth leaders**

      Empowering youth leaders through shared knowledge, mentorship and facilitated collaboration with the youth organisations they are part of.

      **Bringing different opinions together**

      Making democratic collective decisions about the development of the network, building trust and communication among members.

      ## Some Other Initiatives by Citizen OS
