      ## An Invitation to Collaborate

      We at Citizen OS, a civic tech non-profit based working all around the world to enhance democracy and participation in civil society, cordially invite you to collaborate in the development of a new community of practice – the Participatory Youth Leadership Network (PYLN).

      ## The Network

      The Participatory Youth Leadership Network is a dedicated network for youth organisations all across India to collaborate and share best practice in the areas of participatory leadership and civic engagement.

      As part of the network, members will gain valuable insights, skills, knowledge and contacts to help achieve their youth organisation’s goals in the most innovative and democratic ways.

      The network will be divided into two parts – external collaboration and internal collaboration.

      External collaboration involves a comprehensive programme of free webinars, workshops, training
      sessions and networking on topics such as inclusive leadership, constructive argumentation, theory of change and values-centred approaches. This programme will be attended by youth organisations in India, Citizen OS and our international contributors.

      Internal collaboration involves organisations forming their own steering groups and deciding their own agendas using the civic tools provided by [Citizen OS](https://citizenos.com/platform/). Let it be said, the use of our platform is strictly voluntary, members can use any platform that they mutually agree upon.

      ## The Process

      Keeping in mind that countries have different contexts, we would like the India chapter of PYLN to focus on building a community of practice in the Indian context. We are looking at community members to form their own steering groups, keeping in mind their organisational interests.

      However, as mentioned above, our international contributors will join our structured programme in order to learn, understand and share.
