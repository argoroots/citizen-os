            As an organization, Citizen OS wants to help the general public in getting involved and getting their voices heard.

            We invest in reseach and studies to help us understand better the needs of communities and how participatory democracy can make a difference.

            The Citizen OS conference is a bi-annual meeting for e-democracy researchers.
