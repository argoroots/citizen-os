            ## A word from the team
            ### **We are here to do good**, not get rich.{.my-3}

            A lot of startups say that they want to change the world. We don’t claim that. What we want is to educate the people because they are the ones that can change the world – by recognising that their opinions can be voiced. And we want to help and provide the tools so that those voices can be heard.
