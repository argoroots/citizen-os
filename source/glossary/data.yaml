            Account, similar to many web services, is a collection of user's information, preferences and usage history. It is non-public and specific to a single user.

        term: activity feed
        description: |
            A chronological list of important activities customised for each individual user.

        term: argument
        description: |

An argument consists of a statement and supportive reasoning and examples to support that statement. An argument can be either for (pro) or against (con) the proposal in the topic. Use of arguments is a characteristic of a debate.

        term: author
        description: |
            Every topic in Citizen OS has a creator, authors and users. Authors are users, who have edited the topic text. Users, who only vote on a topic or post arguments about a topic are NOT authors.

        description: |
            During the topic creation phase, users with topic editing rights can select any part of text in the topic body and suggest a change to it in the pop-up window, which opens when text is selected. The change proposal is only visible within the same group of admin & moderators.

        term: Citizen OS
        description: |
            Citizen OS is an e-democracy and decisionmaking platform. It comprises a web service, an open source code and an open API. It is a proper name and as such, non-translatable. OS is an abbreviation of operating system.

        term: collaborate

        description: |

        term: creator
        description: |
            Every topic in Citizen OS has a creator (and may have multiple authors and users). A creator is a user who initially created the topic. A creator is always listed as one of the authors as well, regardless of whether they actually did edit the topic or not. A creator always receives full admin rights to the topic by default.
    -
        term: discussion
        description: |
            Discussion is a catchall term for arguments, replies and comments about a single topic, whether posted in-line or below the topic. To paraphrase, it's the "discussion about the main body of the topic".
    -
        term: eID
        description: |
            Or "e-identification": the link between the online identity and the physical person behind it is verified to a high degree of certainty (as opposed to "social login", which allows you to log in via social networks and doesn't necessarily prove you're the one who you claim to be).

            This will require the user to identify themselves using an official electronic ID, such as the Estonian ID-card/mobile-ID/smart-ID.
    -
        term: email
        description: |
            Electronic mail - a method of exchanging messages ("mail") between people using electronic devices.
    -
        term: follow-up
        description: |
            Follow-up in this case means a stage for the topic. A topic in Citizen OS can be in three different stages: in progress, in voting or in follow-up. Follow-up stage is the final stage, where users can post updates about how the decision, which was created and voted upon, is being put into force. Hence, users "follow up" on the implementation of the decision.

            For example, "Community proposals were discussed at the local municipality." could be an event/update, following up on how a decision made via Citizen OS is being implemented.

        term: group
        description: |
            Citizen OS has groups of users, who regularly decide together. If a number of users will only jointly decide on a single topic once, they could be invited to directly participate in the said topic. However, if they are likely to decide on multiple topics, it is easier to create a group, add the users to the group and then invite the group to participate in the topic. Making a group especially makes sense for users, who form groups outside of Citizen OS as well, such as villages, city districts, NGO members etc.

        term: in progress
        description: |
            "In progress" in this case means a status/stage of the topic. A topic in Citizen OS can be in three different stages: in progress, in voting or in follow-up. "In progress" stage is the first stage, where users can discuss the proposal (comment, offer alternatives, edit wording etc.) that will later be voted on.
    -
        term: invite link
        description: |
            Admins can generate an invite link for their topic - every user with a Citizen OS account, who clicks on the link, will auto-join the topic and become its member. People without an account will be prompted with a login pop-up prior to being able to join the topic.

    -
        term: update
        description: |
            Academic research suggests, that following up on decisions is important for voter satisfaction. Citizen OS therefore has special features for tracking, how the decision created via Citizen OS is being implemented. It's called the "Follow-up stage", where a user can add updates about how the decision or document is being put into force. Thus, an update is an implementation action. For example, "Community proposals were discussed at the local municipality." could be an update, implementing a decision made in Citizen OS.
    -
        term: user
        description: |
            A user is a physical person registered to use the Citizen OS system. Users can have multiple access rights, so if an admin rights user deletes something, it will still show up as "a user deleted". User is, therefore, a generic term and does not imply the level of rights.
    -
        term: vote
        description: |
            A vote is a user's decision, given via Citizen OS, on the topic in question. Each user has one or more votes per question, depending on the voting settings. Voting settings are defined by the admin who moves the topic into voting stage. A vote in Citizen OS is similar to the vote a citizen has in elections in a democratic country or in a shareholder's meeting.

            Voting means making and indicating a decision by the user via Citizen OS on the topic in question. To vote in Citizen OS means to choose one or more responses from a list of voting options. Options may be "Yes", "No", "Neutral" or other, customised phrases.   "
